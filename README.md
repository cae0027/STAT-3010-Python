# STAT 3010 — Statistics for Scientists and Engineers

This repository contains course materials for **STAT 3010**, following *Navidi, Statistics for Engineers and Scientists (6th ed.)*.  
The course emphasizes **statistical reasoning** and **hands-on analysis using Python**, with no prior programming experience assumed.

---

## Course Structure
- **Lectures:** Conceptual foundations and worked examples
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Step-by-step walkthroughs that reproduce all numeric and data-based examples from lecture slides
- **Reading & Quizzes:** Reinforce interpretation and computation
- **Exams:** Focus on understanding, not memorization

---

## Software & Tools
- Python (via Jupyter / Colab)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy
- No advanced programming required

---

## Topics Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics (mean, median, variance, quartiles)
- Graphical summaries (stem-and-leaf, histograms, boxplots)
- Probability and distributions
- Point and interval estimation
- Hypothesis testing
- Linear regression and correlation

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Summarize and interpret real-world data
- Choose appropriate numerical and graphical summaries
- Understand variability and uncertainty
- Apply statistical methods to science and engineering problems
- Use Python as a practical tool for statistical analysis

## How to Use This Repository
1. Start with the notebook for the corresponding lecture.
2. Run cells **top to bottom**.
3. Read the explanations before executing code.
4. Modify values to explore “what-if” scenarios.
